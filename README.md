# NeuS-HSR
This is the official repo for the implementation of "Looking Through the Glass: Neural Surface Reconstruction Against High Specular Reflections" paper (CVPR 2023).

We will release our code soon!

# Synthetic Dataset
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11tdooelweg4qzsYN1VzX8zw0-CXO4t9L/view?usp=share_link) only contains images, camera parameters are in [DTU Dataset](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36).

# Real-world Dataset

## Acknowlegement
Our code is built on [NeuS](https://github.com/Totoro97/NeuS) project. 

Our real-world dataset is constructed by following [NeRF++](https://github.com/Kai-46/nerfplusplus) project. 

Thanks for these great projects!
